# HNGi7 LeaderBoard Project
My team and I worked on a leaderboard project showing the list of top interns using HNG-i7 as a case study.

This web application makes it easy to get and know the top interns in the workspace as they are listed according to the points acquired. We started by getting a template that best presents the content, then we generated a dummy JSON file (has requested, the correct data will be fixed in when the access is given) and called it from our GitHub repository to our javascript file and was implemented in the already available design to make it functional.

## Technology Used:

- HTML

- CSS

- JavaScript
